# Replicating-Human-Game-Theory-Experiments-with-LLMs-Phenotypic-Profiles-and-Bias-Modulation
Code used for my master thesis. Each program can be used to play 121 dyadic games with enhanced prompting techniques, including multi-step reasoning and logical verification, to generate cooperation matrices. In each code we have tested different LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B, to which we refer as Llama, Qwen and Mistral for simplicity.

For the plots I use theoretical matrices of phenotypes and human results of the experiment _Reference:_ Poncela-Casasnovas, J., Gutiérrez-Roig, M., Gracia-Lázaro, C., Vicens, J., Gómez-Gardeñes, J., Perelló, J., Moreno, Y., Duch, J., & Sánchez, A.
