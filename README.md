# Replicating-Human-Game-Theory-Experiments-with-LLMs-Phenotypic-Profiles-and-Bias-Modulation
Code used for my master thesis. Each program can be used to play 121 dyadic games with enhanced prompting techniques, including multi-step reasoning and logical verification, to generate cooperation matrices. In each code we have tested different LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B, to which we refer as Llama, Qwen and Mistral for simplicity.

| Llama_finalversion.py   |  Play 121 games with Llama                   |
| Mistral_finalversion.py   |    Play 121 games with Mistral                 |
| Qwen_finalversion.py  |  Play 121 games with Qwen                |
| Plots.ipynb   |      Code for the plots               |
| Nash.ipynb   |     Code for getting Nash equilibrium of all games                |

For the plots I use theoretical matrices of phenotypes and human results of the experiment by Poncela-Casasnovas et al. (2016) *Humans display a reduced set of consistent behavioral phenotypes in dyadic games.
