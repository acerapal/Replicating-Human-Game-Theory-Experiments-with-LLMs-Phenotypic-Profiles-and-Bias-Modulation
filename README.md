Code used for my master thesis.
Each program can be used to play 121 dyadic games with enhanced prompting techniques, including multi-step reasoning and logical verification, to generate cooperation matrices. 
In each code we have tested different LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B, to which we refer as Llama, Qwen and Mistral for simplicity.
We have used models that were in the BSC cluster but we provide the structure so you can play with your local models.
